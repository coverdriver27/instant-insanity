1 + (n7) (mod 30)
1 + (n11) (mod 30)

work

Under multiplication, the group { Z/mZ , x } is cyclic iff there there exists an element, called a generator=g such that gcd (m,g) = 1
This is p much an application of lagrange's theorem,
and since we know (7n)(mod 30) and (11n) are cyclic

The colors of the generator will appear the same way 3 times for n= 1 ... 90 (will drop the kids off in the same equivalence classes 3 times)
so those 2 generators specifically are easy to solve

all prisms generated will be of 10 equivalence class variations of, <a,b,c> cycles
of which which have solution 

abc
cab
bca

I have no idea how to code this at all, but thats how you solve the last 2
